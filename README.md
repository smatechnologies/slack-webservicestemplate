# Slack messages from OpCon
This example shows how you can run the Web Services connector to send a message to a workspace in Slack. The message could be information about a failed job or other pertinent alerts.

# Prerequisites
* Slack ( with access to <a href="https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks">Incoming Webhooks</a> )
* OpCon 18.3+

# Instructions
There are many applications for this example but a common use case would be to send a Slack message when an OpCon job fails.  One way to set this up would be to create a trigger in Notification Manager when a job fails.  The trigger would execute a "Run Command" option and pass the necessary information about the failed job to the Web Services connector.

You will need to update the " < your url > " portion of the Web Services step to match the URL generated by Slack for your Incoming Webhook.
